# Tabstracted - An open source browser tab manager

## The Goal
An easy-to-use, feature complete tab manager extension for organizing tabs into workspaces.

## Disclaimer
I am currently in the process of migrating/rewriting everything in Typescript, so the software is of not much use, and you might see a lot of skeleton code aswell.

------

This extension uses the [Svelte Typescript Chrome Extension Boilerplate](https://github.com/NekitCorp/chrome-extension-svelte-typescript-boilerplate)
